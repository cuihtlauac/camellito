### Get Started

Click the green “Code” button, select the _Codespaces_ tab, and create your own. Not too long after, you should be in VS Code inside your browser. Go to the “TERMINAL” tab, extend it and run `dune test`. Tests should fail; this is normal.

### Read some Docs

So that you know, you'll be given access to the documentation you need to use to complete the task. Please do not refer to other documentation.

### Code!

Open the files `task.ml` and `task.mli`.
* `task.mli` - describes what the functions should do.
* `task.ml` - write your code here.

**Tip**: To implement function `discuss_wc` you need install package `curly` using Opam.

### Build and Test

Here is the command you need to type to build your code:
```shell
$ dune build
```

Here is the command you need to type to test your code:
